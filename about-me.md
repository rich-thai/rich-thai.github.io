## Experience
**Research Assistant** York University (Toronto, Canada), Sep 2014 – Aug 2020 (writing thesis)
* Created and managed a Microsoft Access database to store and query experiment data using SQL. Implemented a schema for communicating with instrumentation with device calibration parameters.
* Analyzed large volumes of data with various statistical methods to detect signal signature using Python.
* Wrote parameter optimization programs such as gradient descent, principle component analysis to simplify experiment controls, and for stability.
* Performed Monte-Carlo simulations in Python to design a detector system that improves that enhances signals by a factor of >6.
* Trained a random forest machine learning model to classify signals due to experiment or from background using regression-analyzed, labelled data, with an accuracy of >90%.

**Visiting Researcher (upon urgent request)** CERN (Geneva, Switzerland), Sep 2017 – Oct 2017
* Provided management and training for a team of graduate students to operate experiments, analyze data, and how to troubleshoot. Developed experimental methods to re-establish high-priority experiments within two weeks of arrival.

**Research Assistant** McMaster University Nuclear Reactor (Hamilton, Canada), Mar 2017 – Aug 2017
* Performed proof-of-principle experiments to collect data from the nuclear reactor running at low power. Detected the first reactor-based antimatter beam in Canada.
* Analyzed data to optimize the apparatus for permanent installation. Forecasted large number of antimatter generated for the reactor operating at full power.

Hello! Welcome to my portfolio.


### Bike Sharing Demand
[Bike Sharing Demand](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand/overview) was a Kaggle competition using a dataset provided by Capital Bikeshare. The bike rental data contains two years worth of information such as the date/time of the rental, weather, and seasonality. The task was to predict that demand of bike share rentals for selected hours of the days for multiple dates. I used a supervised machine learning model to predict the rentals, as shown in [this notebook](https://github.com/rich-thai/Bike-Sharing-Demand/blob/master/BikeSharing.ipynb).
